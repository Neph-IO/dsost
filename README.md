This is a simple music streamer project for my understanding of git, python, and flatpak.


# IMPORTANT

Arch:

`sudo pacman -S gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-ugly gst-libav python-gobject gobject-introspection`

Debian:

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav python3-gi gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0`
